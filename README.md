## Hello, I'm NiumXp
The `Xp` in my name is a reference to **Windows XP** and, `Nium`... is the sound that **Formula 1** cars make when they are running extremely fast.

I like to **help other people**, **books**, **functional** and **object-oriented programming**.

### I have questions!
These four words is what my life was without Jesus, Socrate, John Galt and Satoshi Nakamoto.

Are you feeling bad, alone, etc.? Try Jesus.<br>
Are you convinced about the truth? Try Socrate.<br>
Are you lost? Find John Galt!<br>

Always remember that humans is less than 0.01% of a leaf in a giant tree.

### Something cool?
```py
() = range(0)  # PEP 3132
```

```hs
λ> 2+2 = 5
λ> 2+2
5
```
